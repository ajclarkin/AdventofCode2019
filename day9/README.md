# Day 9 #
Another quick one - after the length of time it took to sort through the issues with day 7 part 2 the two short ones were appreciated 
to get me back on track. Unfortunately by this time Christmas had passed and Santa is still stranded.

More intcode. Of course. Part 2 was the same as part 1 this time so the same program solves both given the correct input.
