# Day 12 #
The problems are getting harder or I'm not putting in enough thought.

## Part 1 ##
Easy, completed in less than 20 minutes. So, that was deceptive.

## Part 2 ##
"Should be easy" I thought. I saw the message suggesting finding a more efficient way of working it all out but with a 
modern computer it'll be fine, right?

A technically correct solution was easy but boy was it inefficient. I stopped it running after about an hour before the laptop ran out 
of ram. So then what? (I thought about junmping into c to run faster but that's not the point.)

I eventually had to look to reddit for help. That was frustrating because at least some of the deductions should have been obvious. 
I really should have realised that the first position to repeat *must* be the origin given that there was a vector attached. 
Separating out the 3 components makes sense too. I used numpy to find the least common multiple because why wouldn't you.
